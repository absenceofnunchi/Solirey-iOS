 Abstract:
 Resale of a tangible item through shipping.
 The difference between a new sale and a resale is that the mintHash is going to be "Resale" since no new token is being minted.
 Therefore, only a new escrow contract is to be deployed and skips the call to the mint method.
 Also, the unique identifier has to be reused and bypass the duplicate check.
 
 For digital resale, the same image has to be reused.
